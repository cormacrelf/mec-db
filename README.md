MecDB
-----

A distributed key-value store based on Riak and Dynamo, built in Go on top of ZeroMQ and LevelDB.

This is a fun project, not an enterprise-ready behemoth. Please don't use it for anything. 

### Installation

```
go get github.com/cormacrelf/mec-db/mec/
```

### Usage

#### Mec command

Syntax:

```
mec --config /path/to/config.conf
```

The MecDB config file is formatted with [TOML](https://github.com/mojombo/toml), and follows this format:

```toml
# name of instance must be unique in cluster.
name = "apple-juice-93"
# on which the cluster communicates
port = 7000
# on which the HTTP server runs
httpport = 3000
# created if it doesn't already exist
root = "/path/to/leveldb/root/directory"

# then a list of other known nodes in the cluster (I recommend 3 total at this stage)
[[node]]
    host = "127.0.0.1"  
    port = 8000
[[node]]
    host = "127.0.0.1"
    port = 9000
```

Note that you'll want `port + 1` to be open as well, since MecDB binds an N-to-1 ZeroMQ socket there.

#### API

MecDB offers an HTTP API.

**GET /mec/:key**

Performs a repairing read using R nodes. Gives back the consolidated data and a Vector Clock (X-Mec-Vclock) which a client should send when making PUT/POST requests.

Handles multiple responses for siblings with `300 Multiple Choices`.

*Single Response format*:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 17
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:42:53 GMT
X-Mec-Vclock: gapjb3JtYWNyZWxmgqdDb3VudGVyAalUaW1lc3RhbXDPE0nH5/H4nFU=

"I am a machine"
```

*Multiple Choice format*:

When clients A, B, and C have written versions 1-3 respectively, simultaneously on different servers such that they have divergent clocks. Consists of `mime/multipart`-separated responses that each have a Last-Modified and unix-nanosecond timestamp. Only one VClock is returned, which is a descendent of each of the multiple responses such that a client may resolve the conflict by POST/PUTting passing the merged clock and a merged value.

version 2

```

**PUT /mec/:key**
**POST /mec/:key**

Performs a write using W nodes. The client must pass its latest known Vector Clock associated with the key to avoid siblings. Gives back an incremented VClock.

Response format:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 0
Content-Type: application/json
Date: Thu, 16 Jan 2014 08:52:18 GMT
